excerpt: ' Ionic homeostasis in plants is a complex set of traits that is essential for plant growth, survival and seed production. An understanding of the genetic architecture underlying the ionome is therefore vital for breeding efforts. To identify regions of the genome associated with ionic homeostasis in the Setaria species complex, QTL mapping was performed on a RIL population resulting from the interspecific cross between S. viridis and S. italica. The population was subjected to treatments which assayed the effects of planting density and water availability. The flag leaves of these plants were then harvested and subjected to ICP-MS to assay their ionomic content. These phenotypic data were then used to map the regions of the genome that are associated with alterations in the ionome of the species complex. Further mapping was performed using the rotated loadings of principal components analyses which were performed on the phenotypic data resulting from the initial grow-outs. A total of 251 QTL were identified. Multiple concentrated regions of QTL were identified that overlapped with regions previously identified as important for the trait of water use efficiency.
