excerpt: ' In order to assess the variation in iron accumulation in <i>Setaria</i>, a diverse group of landraces and cultivars were grown in soil and hydroponically with varied amounts of ion. Dry root and shoot weight were assessed, as was yield by weight. Additionally, the uppermost leaf was taken and the concentrations of 20 different elements in the plant were assessed. The unsupervised machine learning algorithm DBSCAN allowed for the identification of two separate ionomically defined groups and three morphologically defined groups. These groupings did not show strong intercorrelation, with the exception of one ionomic group, which did correspond to the African morphology group. The second ionomic group appeared to show a constitutive phosphate deficiency response. The results suggest that there is considerable variation in iron content and room for improvement. '
