excerpt: 'Quantitative trait locus mapping is a strategy for the identification of genomic regions that are associated with a trait of interest. Previous methods for the statistical validation of the results of quantitative trait locus mapping studies are labor-intensive or rely on fragile assumptions. In this paper, we explore the possibility of validation of quantitative trait loci through resampling of the genome. We aim to determine the likelihood of finding a particular number of previously known genes given the null hypothesis of random placement of quantitative trait loci. We ultimately advocate for the use of a new, probabilistic method which takes into account the current knowledge of genes that contribute to the trait of interest, the difficulties with accommodating the edges of chromosomes, and the requirement for smoothness in resampling with replacement. We then present an open-source software package that can run this method in seconds or less, with no pre-processing required.'
