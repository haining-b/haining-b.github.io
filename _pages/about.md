Hi!  I’m Brianna Haining, a computational biologist living in Berkeley, CA. I recently graduated from the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at the University of California Berkeley, where I had the pleasure of being advised by Sarah Hake. Before Berkeley, I studied at New York University Abu Dhabi, where I completed my Bachelors in Biology. 

The bulk of my PhD was dedicated to maximizing our agricultural system’s resilience to climate change. To address the pressing need for rapid germplasm improvement in crop species, I worked to elucidate the genomic architecture underlying ionic homeostasis in the emerging model organism foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>).
